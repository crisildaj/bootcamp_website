        <h3>Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)</h3>
        <p>DSDM is an Agile framework that focuses on delivering projects on time and within budget while maintaining high quality. It promotes frequent feedback, active user involvement, and prioritization of requirements.</p>
        <p>DSDM has specific roles. We have adapted the roles to suit the needs and scope of this project.</p>
        <p>Here is the full 'baby alien' model showign the ideal DSDM set up. Next to it we have the set up for our own project</p>

It divides projects into fixed duration iterations called sprints, cross functional teams work to deliver a shipable increment of the product. Scrum emphasizes adaptability, transparency, and continuous improvement through regular meetings Daily Scrum, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective.

        <h3>How we applied Scrum</h3>
        <p>Initally we allocatd roles, one person assumed the role of product owner taking ownership of the product backlog, the remaining four members of the team rotated the scrum master role. All members of the team assumed the role of developer. We used four one week sprints, daily standups took place Monday - Friday via online video conferencing with cameras on. Sprint planning and estimation was based on hours, each developer showcased their work during sprint reviews and amended any work based on feedback. Sprint retrospectives highlighted process improvements which we put into the sprint backlog to apply during the next sprint. We developed Iteratively and delivered incrementally.

            <h2>The Design Thinking Process</h2> 
        <p>Design thinking is a creative and user-centered approach to problem-solving that is often used in the context of web design and product development. It emphasizes understanding the needs and preferences of the end-users to create a more appealing, engaging and functional product.

        <h3>How we applied Design Thinking Process</h3>
        <p>The design thinking process is made up of the problem space and the solution space and can be broken down into the following phases. 
            <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Empathize</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Define</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ideate</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prototype</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Test</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Implement</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Iterate</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
          By following the process we were able to explore both the problem space and the solution space identifying user pain points and exploiting opportunities. To aid us in the design process we used tools such as user persona cards, user journey mapping, double diamond and scamper models.
          One of the key pain points identified was 'fragmented learning experience'.
