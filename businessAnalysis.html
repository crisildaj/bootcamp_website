    <h1>Business Analysis</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt;">Business analysis is all about identifying business needs and determining the soltuions to business problems</p>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt;">There are many different processes that are used in business analysis, and on this webpage we will cover three</p>

            <h2 class="infoHeadings">How we applied our knowledge to the project:</h2>
            <ul style="font-size: 15pt;">
                <li>Resource Audit to identify key resources we would use during our project: </li>

                <li>JavaScript is used to add the functionality to the website</li>

            <h3>Process Mapping is a method used to outline the steps within a process, identifying task ownders and detailing expected timelines</h3>
            <h3 class="infoHeadings">Despite Process Mapping not being used, it would have been useful for:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Outlining the steps in creating the website that the Technophobes have created.</li>
                <li>There is a start and end point to every process map and specific tasks are to be completed before proceeding to the next.</li>
                <li>The process map on the  right was done in a exercise during the business analysis week and is for the graduate process for the technology graduate scheme.</li>
                <li>If there is a failure at any point within the process,a notification is sent tothe applicant to apply next year. If a pass , then proceed to the next step.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="infoHeadings">The key for the Process Map is as follows</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial Nodes and Final Nodes determine the start and the end to the process. Each task is shown with the rectangle and when completed follows the next recttangle connected via a flow arrow.</li>
                <li>The decision diamons determine  a pass or fail condition, where if met, proceed to the pass/yes flow arrow, else proceed the the fail/no path.</li>
                <li>Joins can only be proceeded when both events are completed at the same time, Forks occur when a individual event can lead to two different events.</li>
                <li>Applying Swimlanes means that the process is split horizontallly to different lanes, where each lane represents a actor doing a specific task within the process map</li>
            </ul>
            </ol>
